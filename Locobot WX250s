How to run the Locobot if It is crashed? (If not, do not use this tutorial)

You need a remote computer to send the commands and receive data from the Locobot’s computer.
After connecting a monitor, mouse and keyboard to the locobot you need to install different packages on both locobot and remote computer.
For remote Computer:
1- Intstalling Uunutu 20.04 from
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04
2- install ROS rvis and rosdep
2- Edit the file of bashrc with this command: (gedit ~/.bashrc) and check if these part are added or add this parts:

source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
# Interbotix Configurations
source /home/mhsnar/interbotix_ws/devel/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp
export INTERBOTIX_XSLOCOBOT_BASE_TYPE=create3
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.4:11311
export ROS_IP=$(echo `hostname -I | cut -d" " -f1`)
if [ -z "$ROS_IP" ]; then
	export ROS_IP=127.0.0.1
fi
For Robot’s Computer
1- Intstalling Uunutu 20.04 from booted flash.
2- update and upgrde apt

#export ROS_IP=$(echo `hostname -I | cut -d" " -f1`)
#if [ -z "$ROS_IP" ]; then
#	export ROS_IP=127.0.0.1
